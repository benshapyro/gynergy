# Upwork Project: Complete MVP Features for Gynergy Journal App

## Project Overview

We are looking for a full-stack developer to complete the MVP features of our "Gynergy Journal App" – a gamified journaling platform built with Next.js 14, React, and TypeScript. The app uses Supabase for authentication and data management, and will integrate with OpenAI's Vision API for OCR processing of handwritten journal entries. Our immediate goal is to prepare the app for our US-based test group by completing and polishing core MVP features.

## What's Already Done

- **User Authentication:**  
  - ✅ Email-based magic link authentication via Supabase is fully implemented
  
- **Core Journal Flows:**  
  - ✅ **Morning Journal Flow:** Fully implemented with mood tracking, reflection, affirmations, gratitude, and excitement items
  - ✅ **Evening Journal Flow:** Fully implemented with mood tracking, reflection, and planning for tomorrow
  
- **History Views:**
  - ✅ List view of past journal entries
  - ✅ Calendar view for entry navigation
  
- **Basic Infrastructure:**
  - ✅ Database schema for journal entries, points, and user data
  - ✅ Basic profile system with user information
  - ✅ File upload system structure
  
- **Partial Implementations:**
  - ⚠️ **Daily Quote:** Component ready, needs quote library integration
  - ⚠️ **Mountain Progress:** Component with milestones defined, needs points connection
  - ⚠️ **Daily Gratitude Action:** Flow implemented, needs action library integration
  - ⚠️ **Points System:** Database structure ready, needs completion
  - ⚠️ **OCR Integration:** File upload structure ready, needs Vision API implementation
  - ⚠️ **Leaderboard:** Basic component exists, needs weekly implementation
